# Learning Rust

Basically just going to be going through the `rustup docs --book` *The Book* and learning Rust. It will be a fun journey.

One thing I automatically don't like about Rust is that you have to download dependencies to program, which means you *have* to be connected to the internet. a bit annoying.
